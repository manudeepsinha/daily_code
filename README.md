# daily_commit
Update (2021-03-02): Officially discontinued the series.<br>
When I started this, I didn't use to code daily and this repo made me a consistent coder for the better part. <br>
But a couple of days back when I'm unable to code something good, I would just do basic programs to not break the streak. <br>
This habit was becoming unhealthy so I've decided to stop committing code regularly, but continue learning something new, everyday!<br>
Cheers!<br><br>
This repo is to keep track of my practice of concepts/ solving problems while brushing up or learning new topics in the field of software engineering. 
The sole purpose of this repo is to be consistent in coding and solving problems daily to improve and grow as a programmer. 
The problems difficulty ranges from pretty basic to advanced and complex ones.
There might be some days when either I'm travelling, or I've some engagements that I prefer to engage myself in. Those days, I'll be enjoying life with no guilt :)

Missed days: <br>
<b>2021-01-07</b>    Had my code ready but was exhausted that forgot to commit. <br>
<b>2021-01-28</b>    Done uploading but forgot to commit. Still in commit under same date. <br>
<b>2021-02-18</b>    Had my code ready a day before but didn't commit. (Went out of station for job opportunity and no laptop) <br>
<b>2021-02-23</b>    Had my code ready but forgot to commit.<br><br>
Happy coding!
